# 1. Value of Risk
## <font color=blue>1.1 Mean-Variance Framework
Under traditional framework, **<font color=fuchsia>mean and variance</font>** is used to model financial risk and return follows normal distribution.
- The **mean return** is used to measure the expected return.
- The **standard deviation** is used to measure the risk.

**<font color=fuchsia>The efficient frontier(有效前沿)</font>** is useful to construct the suitable asset combination. Investors can achieve the highest expected return for a given level of risk and minimize the level of risk for a given expected return along the efficient frontier.

The **<font color=fuchsia>normal distribution</font>** is often assumed for the returns on financial variables. It is a convenient choice because all we need is the mean and standard deviation of the returns. In practice, financial variables tend to have <font color=red>much fatter tails</font> than normal distributions.

##  <font color=blue>1.2 Value at Risk
**<font color=fuchsia>VaR</font>** is the loss that we do not expect to be exceeded over the <font color=red>time horizon</font> at the specified <font color=red>confidence level</font>.

10-day $99\%$ VaR is 10 million
- We are $99\%$ certain that the loss during the next 10 days will be less than USD 10 million.
- There is a probability of only $1\%$ that the loss over the next 10 days will be greater than USD 10 million.

**Example**: A trader accumulated 100 daily returns for a 2 million portfolio. After sorting the returns into ascending order, the lowest ten returns were provided
-12.3%, -8.7%, -6.5%, -6.34%, -3.2%, -2,87%, -1.2%, -0.59%, -0,05%, 0.47%

Please calculate the daily VaR at 5% significance level.
| Return | Probability | Cumulative Probability Range |
|--|--|--|
| -12.30%| 1% | 1% |
| -8.70% | 1%  | 2% |
| -6.50% | 1%  |  3%|
| -6.34% | 1%  | 4% |
| -3.20% | 1%  | 5% |
| -2.87% | 1%  | 6% |
| -1.20% | 1%  | 7% |
| -0.59% | 1%  | 8%|
| -0.05% | 1%  | 9% |
| 0.47% | 1%  | 10% |

$VaR_{daily}(5\%)=3.2\%\;or\; 64,000$

Assume that asset returns conform to a <font color=red>normal distribution</font>.

$VaR(X\%)=|E(R)-Z_{X\%}\times \sigma|$

$VaR(X\%)_{dollar}=|E(R)-Z_{X\%}\times \sigma| \times \text{Asset Value}$

**Example**: Cindy is a trader and she is using VaR to measure the risk of her portfolio. She assumes the asset return distribution is normally distributed. The portfolio daily standard deviation is $2.5\%$ and has a current value of $7.8 million. Please calculate the daily percentage VaR($5\%$) and daily dollar VaR($5\%$) of this portfolio.

$VaR(5\%)=2.5\%\times1.645=4.11\%$ （默认均值是$0$）

$VaR(5\%)_{dollar}=0.0411\times 7.8 million = 320,775$ 


The VaR for an investment opportunity is a function of two parameters:
- **The time horizon**: VaR increases when the holding period is longer.
- **The confidence level**: VaR increases when the degree of confidence increases.

Assuming return is normally distributed and $E(R)=0$, $VaR(X\%)=|Z_{X\%}\times\sigma|$
- Time horizon: <font color=red>Square root rule</font> can be used.
  
  $\sigma_{J-periods}=\sigma_{1-period}\times\sqrt{J}$  $\to VaR(X\%)_{J-periods}=VaR(X\%)_{1-period}\times\sqrt{J}$
- The confidence level

  $VaR(New\%)=VaR(Old\%)\times(Z_{New\%}/Z_{Old\%})$

Example: A risk analyst has to adjust the $95\%$ daily $VaR$ into $99\%$ weekly $VaR$ to meet the new risk management policy. The $95\%$ daily $VaR$ is $$3,300,000$. Please compute the $99\%$ weekly $VaR$. Assuming daily mean return of zero and $5$ trading days in a week.

$VaR(1\%)_{daily}=VaR(5\%)_{daily}\times(2.33/1.65)=4,660,000$

$VaR(1\%)_{weekly}=VaR(1\%)_{daily}\times\sqrt{5}=10,420,777$

Limitations of Value at risk
**Advantages**: Easy to understand and apply
**Disadvantages**
- Subject to model risk.
- $VaR$ does not describe tail loss and give no indication of how much the tail event might be.
- Not sub-additive.
# 2. Expected Shortfall
##  <font color=blue>2.1 Coherent Risk Measures(一致性风险度量)
**Monotonicity(一致性)**: If(regardless of what happens) a portfolio always produces a worse result than another portfolio, it should have a higher risk measure.

**Translation Invariance(转移不变性)**: If an amount of cash $K$ is added to a portfolio, its risk measure should decrease by $K$.

**Homogeneity(齐次性)**: Changing the size of a portfolio by multiplying the amounts of all the components by $\lambda$ results in the risk measure being multiplied by $\lambda$.
 
**Subadditivity**: For any two portfolios, A and B, the risk measure for the portfolio formed by merging A and B should be no greater than the sum of the risk measures for portfolios A and B.

Why is $VaR$ not subadditive?
**Example**: Suppose there are two bonds, Bond X and Bond Y. Each has a probability default of $3\%$ and $1000 face value, If default occurs, zero value will be recovered. These two bonds are identical and independent. Please calculate the $95\%$ $VaR$ of single bond and then sum then up. Compare the sum of single bond $VaR$ with portfolio $VaR$.

## 2.2 Expected Shortfall
**<font color=fuchsia>Expected Shortfall(ES)</font>** is the expected return being less than the pre-specified quantile return. It also called Conditional VaR or expected tail loss.

It  is the expected value of the worst $(100-X)\%$ of losses.

**Example**: A trader accumulated 100 daily returns for a 2 million portfolio. After sorting the returns into ascending order, the lowest ten returns were provided
-12.3%, -8.7%, -6.5%, -6.34%, -3.2%, -2,87%, -1.2%, -0.59%, -0,05%, 0.47%

Please calculate the daily Expected Shortfall at 5% significance level.
| Return | Probability | Cumulative Probability Range |
|--|--|--|
| -12.30%| 1% | 1% |
| -8.70% | 1%  | 2% |
| -6.50% | 1%  |  3%|
| -6.34% | 1%  | 4% |
| -3.20% | 1%  | 5% |

| 0.47% | 1%  | 10% |

$ES_{daily}(5\%)=(12.3\%+8.7\%+6.5\%+6.34\%)/4=8.49\% or 169,200$
##  <font color=blue>2.3 Expected Shortfall vs. VaR
ES gives an average amount of unfavorable events over a specific period while $VaR$ tells nothing about the exact amount of loss.

ES is the coherent risk measure, $VaR$ is not. ES meets the property of sub-additivity. ES encourage diversification while $VaR$ does not.
##  <font color=blue>2.4 Spectral Risk Measures
Spectral risk measures provide the weighted means of the quantiles of the loss distributions.
- ES is a special case. ES assigns **an equal amount of weight** to all loss levels greater than the $VaR$.
- VaR is also a special case. **All the weight** is assigned to one specific percentile (takes no account of losses more than the X percentile point).

If a risk measure is coherent, the weights should be a **non-decreasing function** of the percentile of a loss distribution.
